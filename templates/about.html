            destined to be- we're trying to spread the good word one bite at a time. Cake Shop is here as a place to display the beauty of cakes, and unite all cake believers on 
            Earth. Here at Cake Shop anyone is free to look at a selection of different cakes, look into how they're made, and talk with other people with similar interests in dessert.

            To my dear brothers and sisters in cake, have patience! Our time has nearly come. Together, we shall purge the world of all evil through the divine power of cake and awaken a 
            new dawn beneath it. Through the blessing of cake, our conquest is inevitable!
